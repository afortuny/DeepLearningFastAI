# DeepLearningFastAI
In the following repo I will share my journey with fastai and deep learning in general. 
I put the time to make sure the code is up to date (not in most of the courses and notebooks from the course are not mapped to the last fastai versions, creating a lot of issues). 
I am running those notebooks in both SageMaker and GoogleCollab to compare for processing speed and performance of difference instance types and seeing code changes in multiple platforms.
