Instead of doing of doing one hot encoding, aggregation or very complex manual feature engineering that require domain knowledge, we can leverage deep learning to create categorical embeddings for our variables and transform them meaningfully into continuous variables.

The embedding layer helped the model to discover the meaning of the different levels of these variables (the levels of a categorical variable do not have an intrinsic meaning, unless we manually specify an ordering using Pandas). In a decision tree, we don't have embeddings layers—so how can these untreated categorical variables do anything useful in a decision tree?

Therefore, our simple decision tree building algorithm will choose that split. Later during training the algorithm will be able to further split the subgroup that contains the expensive Neighborhood, and over time, the tree will home in on that one expensive house.\n",

For binary classification and regression, it was shown that ordering the predictor categories in each split leads to exactly the same splits as the standard approach.

        "In 1994 Berkeley professor Leo Breiman, one year after his retirement, published a small technical report called [\"Bagging Predictors\"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/bagging.pdf), which turned out to be one of the most influential ideas in modern machine learning. The report began:\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***: Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions... The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests… show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.***\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the procedure that Breiman is proposing:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Randomly choose a subset of the rows of your data (i.e., \"bootstrap replicates of your learning set\").\n",
        "1. Train a model using this subset.\n",
        "1. Save that model, and then return to step 1 a few times.\n",
        "1. This will give you a number of trained models. To make a prediction, predict using all of the models, and then take the average of each of those model's predictions. \n",
        "\n",
        "This procedure is known as \"bagging.\" It is based on a deep and important insight: although each of the models trained on a subset of data will make more errors than a model trained on the full dataset, **those errors will not be correlated with each other. Different models will make different errors. The average of those errors, therefore, is: zero! So if we take the average of all of the models' predictions, then we should end up with a prediction that gets closer and closer to the correct answer, the more models we have**. This is an extraordinary result—it means that we can improve the accuracy of nearly any kind of machine learning algorithm by training it multiple times, each time on a different random subset of the data, and averaging its predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2001 Leo Breiman went on to demonstrate that this approach to building models, when applied to decision tree building algorithms, was particularly powerful. He went even further than just randomly choosing rows for each model's training, but also randomly selected from a subset of columns when choosing each split in each decision tree. He called this method the *random forest*.  Today it is, perhaps, the most widely used and practically important machine learning method.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence a random forest is a model that averages the predictions of a large number of decision trees, which are generated by randomly varying various parameters that specify what data is used to train the tree and other tree parameters. Bagging is a particular approach to \"ensembling,\" or combining the results of multiple models together. To see how it works in practice, let's get started on creating our own random forest!"

        "One of the most important properties of random forests is that they aren't very sensitive to the hyperparameter choices, such as `max_features`. You can set `n_estimators` to as high a number as you have time to train—the more trees you have, the more accurate the model will be. `max_samples` can often be left at its default, unless you have over 200,000 data points, in which case setting it to 200,000 will make it train faster with little impact on accuracy. `max_features=0.5` and `min_samples_leaf=4` both tend to work well, although sklearn's defaults work well too.\n",

In the plot, the blue plot line uses the fewest features and the green line uses the most (it uses all the features). As you can see in <<max_features>>, the models with the lowest error result from using a subset of features but with a larger number of trees."

The OOB error is a way of measuring prediction error on the training set by only including in the calculation of a row's error trees where that row was *not* included in training. This allows us to see whether the model is overfitting, without needing a separate validation set.\n",

That validation set is simply the rows that were not selected for that tree's training.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is particularly beneficial in cases where we have only a small amount of training data, as it allows us to see whether our model generalizes without removing items to create a validation set. The OOB predictions are available in the `oob_prediction_` attribute. Note that we compare them to the training labels, since this is being calculated on trees using the training set."

One simple way is to use the standard deviation of predictions across the trees, instead of just the mean. This tells us the *relative* confidence of predictions. In general, we would want to be more cautious of using the results for rows where trees give very different results (higher standard deviations), compared to cases where they are more consistent (lower standard deviations).\n",

The improvement (weighted by the number of rows in that group) is added to the importance score for that feature.

First, we create a function that quickly trains a random forest and returns the OOB score, by using a lower `max_samples` and higher `min_samples_leaf`. The OOB score is a number returned by sklearn that ranges between 1.0 for a perfect model and 0.0 for a random model. (In statistics it's called *R^2*, although the details aren't important for this explanation.) We don't need it to be very accurate—we're just going to use it to compare different models, based on removing some of the possibly redundant columns:"

        "In  the paper [\"Leakage in Data Mining: Formulation, Detection, and Avoidance\"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020496), Shachar Kaufman, Saharon Rosset, and Claudia Perlich describe leakage as: \n",
        "\n",
        "> : The introduction of information about the target of a data mining problem, which should not be legitimately available to mine from. A trivial example of leakage would be a model that uses the target itself as an input, thus concluding for example that 'it rains on rainy days'. In practice, the introduction of this illegitimate information is unintentional, and facilitated by the data collection, aggregation and preparation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "They give as an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "> : A real-life business intelligence project at IBM where potential customers for certain products were identified, among other things, based on keywords found on their websites. This turned out to be leakage since the website content used for training had been sampled at the point in time where the potential customer has already become a customer, and where the website contained traces of the IBM products purchased, such as the word 'Websphere' (e.g., in a press release about the purchase or a specific product feature the client uses).\n",
        "\n",
        "Data leakage is subtle and can take many forms. In particular, missing values often represent data leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, Jeremy competed in a Kaggle competition designed to predict which researchers would end up receiving research grants. The information was provided by a university and included thousands of examples of research projects, along with information about the researchers involved and data on whether or not each grant was eventually accepted. The university hoped to be able to use the models developed in this competition to rank which grant applications were most likely to succeed, so it could prioritize its processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jeremy used a random forest to model the data, and then used feature importance to find out which features were most predictive. He noticed three surprising things:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The model was able to correctly predict who would receive grants over 95% of the time.\n",
        "- Apparently meaningless identifier columns were the most important predictors.\n",
        "- The day of week and day of year columns were also highly predictive; for instance, the vast majority of grant applications dated on a Sunday were accepted, and many accepted grant applications were dated on January 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the identifier columns, one partial dependence plot per column showed that when the information was missing the application was almost always rejected. It turned out that in practice, the university only filled out much of this information *after* a grant application was accepted. Often, for applications that were not accepted, it was just left blank. Therefore, this information was not something that was actually available at the time that the application was received, and it would not be available for a predictive model—it was data leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the same way, the final processing of successful applications was often done automatically as a batch at the end of the week, or the end of the year. It was this final processing date which ended up in the data, so again, this information, while predictive, was not actually available at the time that the application was received.\n",
        "\n",
        "This example showcases the most practical and simple approaches to identifying data leakage, which are to build a model and then:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Check whether the accuracy of the model is *too good to be true*.\n",
        "- Look for important predictors that don't make sense in practice.\n",
        "- Look for partial dependence plot results that don't make sense in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thinking back to our bear detector, this mirrors the advice that we provided in <<chapter_production>>—it is often a good idea to build a model first and then do your data cleaning, rather than vice versa. The model can help you identify potentially problematic data issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can also help you identify which factors influence specific predictions, with tree interpreters."

        "Categorical columns are handled very differently in neural networks, compared to decision tree approaches. As we saw in collaborative filtering, in a neural net a great way to handle categorical variables is by using embeddings. To create embeddings, fastai needs to determine which columns should be treated as categorical variables. It does this by comparing the number of distinct levels in the variable to the value of the `max_card` parameter. If it's lower, fastai will treat the variable as categorical. Embedding sizes larger than 10,000 should generally only be used after you've tested whether there are better ways to group the variable, so we'll use 1,000 as our `max_card`:"

Categorical independent variables are passed through an embedding, and concatenated, as we saw in the neural net we used for collaborative filtering, and then continuous variables are concatenated as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model created in `tabular_learner` is an object of class `TabularModel`. Take a look at the source for `tabular_learner` now (remember, that's `tabular_learner??` in Jupyter). You'll see that like `collab_learner`, it first calls `get_emb_sz` to calculate appropriate embedding sizes (you can override these by using the `emb_szs` parameter, which is a dictionary containing any column names you want to set sizes for manually), and it sets a few other defaults. Other than that, it just creates the `TabularModel`, and passes that to `TabularLearner` (note that `TabularLearner` is identical to `Learner`, except for a customized `predict` method).\n",
        "\n",
        "That means that really all the work is happening in `TabularModel`, so take a look at the source for that now. With the exception of the `BatchNorm1d` and `Dropout` layers (which we'll be learning about shortly), you now have the knowledge required to understand this whole class. Take a look at the discussion of `EmbeddingNN` at the end of the last chapter. Recall that it passed `n_cont=0` to `TabularModel`. We now can see why that was: because there are zero continuous variables (in fastai the `n_` prefix means \"number of,\" and `cont` is an abbreviation for \"continuous\")."

Similar reasoning could be used to consider averaging the predictions of models trained using different algorithms.\n",

The first numeric column contains the results of using the methods on the data provided in the competition; the second column shows what happens if you first train a neural network with categorical embeddings, and then use those categorical embeddings instead of the raw categorical columns in the model. As you see, in every case, the models are dramatically improved by using the embeddings instead of the raw categories.\n",
