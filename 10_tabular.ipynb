The embedding layer helped the model to discover the meaning of the different levels of these variables (the levels of a categorical variable do not have an intrinsic meaning, unless we manually specify an ordering using Pandas). In a decision tree, we don't have embeddings layers—so how can these untreated categorical variables do anything useful in a decision tree? For instance, how could something like a product code be used?\n",

        "The short answer is: it just works! Think about a situation where there is one product code that is far more expensive at auction than any other one. In that case, any binary split will result in that one product code being in some group, and that group will be more expensive than the other group. Therefore, our simple decision tree building algorithm will choose that split. Later during training the algorithm will be able to further split the subgroup that contains the expensive product code, and over time, the tree will home in on that one expensive product.\n",

For binary classification and regression, it was shown that ordering the predictor categories in each split leads to exactly the same splits as the standard approach. This reduces computational complexity because only *k* − 1 splits have to be considered for a nominal predictor with *k* categories."

        "In 1994 Berkeley professor Leo Breiman, one year after his retirement, published a small technical report called [\"Bagging Predictors\"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/bagging.pdf), which turned out to be one of the most influential ideas in modern machine learning. The report began:\n",
        "\n",
        "> : Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions... The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests… show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the procedure that Breiman is proposing:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Randomly choose a subset of the rows of your data (i.e., \"bootstrap replicates of your learning set\").\n",
        "1. Train a model using this subset.\n",
        "1. Save that model, and then return to step 1 a few times.\n",
        "1. This will give you a number of trained models. To make a prediction, predict using all of the models, and then take the average of each of those model's predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This procedure is known as \"bagging.\" It is based on a deep and important insight: although each of the models trained on a subset of data will make more errors than a model trained on the full dataset, those errors will not be correlated with each other. Different models will make different errors. The average of those errors, therefore, is: zero! So if we take the average of all of the models' predictions, then we should end up with a prediction that gets closer and closer to the correct answer, the more models we have. This is an extraordinary result—it means that we can improve the accuracy of nearly any kind of machine learning algorithm by training it multiple times, each time on a different random subset of the data, and averaging its predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2001 Leo Breiman went on to demonstrate that this approach to building models, when applied to decision tree building algorithms, was particularly powerful. He went even further than just randomly choosing rows for each model's training, but also randomly selected from a subset of columns when choosing each split in each decision tree. He called this method the *random forest*. Today it is, perhaps, the most widely used and practically important machine learning method.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence a random forest is a model that averages the predictions of a large number of decision trees, which are generated by randomly varying various parameters that specify what data is used to train the tree and other tree parameters. Bagging is a particular approach to \"ensembling,\" or combining the results of multiple models together. To see how it works in practice, let's get started on creating our own random forest!"

The OOB error is a way of measuring prediction error on the training set by only including in the calculation of a row's error trees where that row was *not* included in training. This allows us to see whether the model is overfitting, without needing a separate validation set.\n",

That validation set is simply the rows that were not selected for that tree's training.\n",

The improvement (weighted by the number of rows in that group) is added to the importance score for that feature.

First, we create a function that quickly trains a random forest and returns the OOB score, by using a lower `max_samples` and higher `min_samples_leaf`. The OOB score is a number returned by sklearn that ranges between 1.0 for a perfect model and 0.0 for a random model. (In statistics it's called *R^2*, although the details aren't important for this explanation.) We don't need it to be very accurate—we're just going to use it to compare different models, based on removing some of the possibly redundant columns:"

        "In  the paper [\"Leakage in Data Mining: Formulation, Detection, and Avoidance\"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020496), Shachar Kaufman, Saharon Rosset, and Claudia Perlich describe leakage as: \n",
        "\n",
        "> : The introduction of information about the target of a data mining problem, which should not be legitimately available to mine from. A trivial example of leakage would be a model that uses the target itself as an input, thus concluding for example that 'it rains on rainy days'. In practice, the introduction of this illegitimate information is unintentional, and facilitated by the data collection, aggregation and preparation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "They give as an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "> : A real-life business intelligence project at IBM where potential customers for certain products were identified, among other things, based on keywords found on their websites. This turned out to be leakage since the website content used for training had been sampled at the point in time where the potential customer has already become a customer, and where the website contained traces of the IBM products purchased, such as the word 'Websphere' (e.g., in a press release about the purchase or a specific product feature the client uses).\n",
        "\n",
        "Data leakage is subtle and can take many forms. In particular, missing values often represent data leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, Jeremy competed in a Kaggle competition designed to predict which researchers would end up receiving research grants. The information was provided by a university and included thousands of examples of research projects, along with information about the researchers involved and data on whether or not each grant was eventually accepted. The university hoped to be able to use the models developed in this competition to rank which grant applications were most likely to succeed, so it could prioritize its processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jeremy used a random forest to model the data, and then used feature importance to find out which features were most predictive. He noticed three surprising things:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The model was able to correctly predict who would receive grants over 95% of the time.\n",
        "- Apparently meaningless identifier columns were the most important predictors.\n",
        "- The day of week and day of year columns were also highly predictive; for instance, the vast majority of grant applications dated on a Sunday were accepted, and many accepted grant applications were dated on January 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the identifier columns, one partial dependence plot per column showed that when the information was missing the application was almost always rejected. It turned out that in practice, the university only filled out much of this information *after* a grant application was accepted. Often, for applications that were not accepted, it was just left blank. Therefore, this information was not something that was actually available at the time that the application was received, and it would not be available for a predictive model—it was data leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the same way, the final processing of successful applications was often done automatically as a batch at the end of the week, or the end of the year. It was this final processing date which ended up in the data, so again, this information, while predictive, was not actually available at the time that the application was received.\n",
        "\n",
        "This example showcases the most practical and simple approaches to identifying data leakage, which are to build a model and then:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Check whether the accuracy of the model is *too good to be true*.\n",
        "- Look for important predictors that don't make sense in practice.\n",
        "- Look for partial dependence plot results that don't make sense in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thinking back to our bear detector, this mirrors the advice that we provided in <<chapter_production>>—it is often a good idea to build a model first and then do your data cleaning, rather than vice versa. The model can help you identify potentially problematic data issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can also help you identify which factors influence specific predictions, with tree interpreters."

As we saw in collaborative filtering, in a neural net a great way to handle categorical variables is by using embeddings.

It does this by comparing the number of distinct levels in the variable to the value of the `max_card` parameter. If it's lower, fastai will treat the variable as categorical. Embedding sizes larger than 10,000 should generally only be used after you've tested whether there are better ways to group the variable, so we'll use 1,000 as our `max_card`:"

Take a look at the discussion of `EmbeddingNN` at the end of the last chapter. Recall that it passed `n_cont=0` to `TabularModel`.

        "So far our approach to ensembling has been to use *bagging*, which involves combining many models (each trained on a different data subset) together by averaging them. As we saw, when this is applied to decision trees, this is called a *random forest*.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Train a small model that underfits your dataset.\n",
        "- Calculate the predictions in the training set for this model.\n",
        "- Subtract the predictions from the targets; these are called the \"residuals\" and represent the error for each point in the training set.\n",
        "- Go back to step 1, but instead of using the original targets, use the residuals as the targets for the training.\n",
        "- Continue doing this until you reach some stopping criterion, such as a maximum number of trees, or you observe your validation set error getting worse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using this approach, each new tree will be attempting to fit the error of all of the previous trees combined. Because we are continually creating new residuals, by subtracting the predictions of each new tree from the residuals from the previous tree, the residuals will get smaller and smaller.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make predictions with an ensemble of boosted trees, we calculate the predictions from each tree, and then add them all together. There are many models following this basic approach, and many names for the same models. *Gradient boosting machines* (GBMs) and *gradient boosted decision trees* (GBDTs) are the terms you're most likely to come across, or you may see the names of specific libraries implementing these; at the time of writing, *XGBoost* is the most popular.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that, unlike with random forests, with this approach there is nothing to stop us from overfitting. Using more trees in a random forest does not lead to overfitting, because each tree is independent of the others. But in a boosted ensemble, the more trees you have, the better the training error becomes, and eventually you will see overfitting on the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are not going to go into detail on how to train a gradient boosted tree ensemble here, because the field is moving rapidly, and any guidance we give will almost certainly be outdated by the time you read this. As we write this, sklearn has just added a `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` class that provides excellent performance. There are many hyperparameters to tweak for this class, and for all gradient boosted tree methods we have seen. Unlike random forests, gradient boosted trees are extremely sensitive to the choices of these hyperparameters; in practice, most people use a loop that tries a range of different hyperparameters to find the ones that work best."

The first numeric column contains the results of using the methods on the data provided in the competition; the second column shows what happens if you first train a neural network with categorical embeddings, and then use those categorical embeddings instead of the raw categorical columns in the model. As you see, in every case, the models are dramatically improved by using the embeddings instead of the raw categories.\n",

You could just use an embedding, which is literally just an array lookup, along with a small decision tree ensemble.\n",

Instead, once a set of embeddings are learned for some column for some task, they could be stored in a central place, and reused across multiple models. In fact, we know from private communication with other practitioners at large companies that this is already happening in many places."
