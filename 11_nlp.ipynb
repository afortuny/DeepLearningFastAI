This kind of task is called *self-supervised learning*: we do not need to give labels to our model, just feed it lots and lots of texts. It has a process to automatically get labels from the data, and this task isn't trivial: to properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to develop an understanding of the English (or other) language. Self-supervised learning can also be used in other domains; for instance, see [\"Self-Supervised Learning and Computer Vision\"](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) for an introduction to vision applications. Self-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pretraining a model used for transfer learning."

We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better. The Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English, so instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could fine-tune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and then use *that* as the base for our classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting. It may be more informal language, or more technical, with new words to learn or different ways of composing sentences. In the case of the IMDb dataset, there will be lots of names of movie directors and actors, and often a less formal style of language than that seen in Wikipedia.\n",

(We expect pretrained models in many more languages to be available soonâ€”they might well be available by the time you are reading this book, in fact.) So, why are we learning how to train a language model in detail?\n",

        "One reason, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine-tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. Since there are 25,000 labeled reviews in the training set and 25,000 in the validation set, that makes 100,000 movie reviews altogether. We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles; this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review.\n",

The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) showed that this extra stage of fine-tuning of the language model, prior to transfer learning to a classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions. Using this approach, we have three stages for transfer learning in NLP, as summarized here:."

As with images, it's best to randomize the order of the inputs, so at the beginning of each epoch we will shuffle the entries to make a new stream (we shuffle the order of the documents, not the order of the words inside them, or the texts would not make sense anymore!).\n",

For instance, if the stream has 50,000 tokens and we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (so from 1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000...), because we want the model to read continuous rows of text (as in the preceding example). An `xxbos` token is added at the start of each during preprocessing, so that the model knows when it reads the stream when a new entry is beginning.\n",

(Be sure to search online for more information about class methods if you're not familiar with them, since they're commonly used in many Python libraries and applications; we've used them a few times previously in the book, but haven't called attention to them.) The reason that `TextBlock` is special is that setting up the numericalizer's vocab can take a long time (we have to read and tokenize every document to get the vocab). To be as efficient as possible it performs a few optimizations: \n",

        "Remember, PyTorch `DataLoader`s need to collate all the items in a batch into a single tensor, and a single tensor has a fixed shape (i.e., it has some particular length on every axis, and all items must be consistent). This should sound familiar: we had the same issue with images. In that case, we used cropping, padding, and/or squishing to make all the inputs the same size. Cropping might not be a good idea for documents, because it seems likely we'd remove some key information (having said that, the same issue is true for images, and we use cropping there; data augmentation hasn't been well explored for NLP yet, so perhaps there are actually opportunities to use cropping in NLP too!). You can't really \"squish\" a document. So that leaves padding!\n",
        "\n",
        "We will expand the shortest texts to make them all the same size. To do this, we use a special padding token that will be ignored by our model. Additionally, to avoid memory issues and improve performance, we will batch together texts that are roughly the same lengths (with some shuffling for the training set). We do this by (approximately, for the training set) sorting the documents by length prior to each epoch. The result of this is that the documents collated into a single batch will tend to be of similar lengths. We won't pad every batch to the same size, but will instead use the size of the largest document in each batch as the target size. (It is possible to do something similar with images, which is especially useful for irregularly sized rectangular images, but at the time of writing no library provides good support for this yet, and there aren't any papers covering it. It's something we're planning to add to fastai soon, however, so keep an eye on the book's website; we'll add information about this as soon as we have it working well.)\n",
